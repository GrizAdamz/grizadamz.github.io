# Hi there, I'm Nick Selleh!

I'm an IT professional with about a decade of experience. I've been a developer, sysadmin, and wildland firefighter as well.

I'm currently enabling and empowering a Healthcare Data Science team via devops. I primarily speak Linux, Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes and Bash. I can dive into JS or Python when the need arises. Automation is my bread, and Security is my butter.

If you would like to get in touch, please email me at *nick@nickselleh.info*.

Thanks for stopping by.
