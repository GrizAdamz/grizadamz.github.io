  <h1>Hi there, I'm Nick Selleh!</h1>

  <p>I'm an IT professional with about a decade of experience. I've been a developer, sysadmin, and wildland firefighter as well. </p>

  <p>I'm currently enabling and empowering a Healthcare Data Science team via real world Devops. I primarily speak Linux, Docker, OpenShift, Kubernetes and Bash and can dive into JS or Python when the need arises. Automation is my bread, and Security is my butter.</p>

  <p>If you would like to get in touch, please email me at <a href="mailto:nick@nickselleh.info">nick@nickselleh.info</a>.</p>

  <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
